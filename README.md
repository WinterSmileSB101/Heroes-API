    "name": "Li-Ming",
    "description": "It&#x2019;s a generally agreed upon fact of life among the denizens of Sanctuary that wizards and magical mayhem are never far apart. Although she understands people&#x2019;s concerns, Li-Ming is entirely unapologetic for the destruction in her wake. She delights in unleashing devastating spells on her foes from afar, then teleporting away to frustrate her enemies&#x2019; attempts at striking back. Small minds may fear this kind of power, but Li-Ming wields the arcane forces of the universe with confidence and unmatched skill.",

    "description": "Upon first glance, few would think of the diminutive Gazlowe as a fighter, but what he lacks in height, he more than makes up for in mechanical cunning.
